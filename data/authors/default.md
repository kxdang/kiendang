My name is Kien (pronounced /'key in/). I am a Software Developer at theScore and I have a Bachelor of Science in Honours Biochemistry from the University of Waterloo.

Iâ€™m a self motivated learner who likes to program and one of my favourite things to do is try to automate tasks I encounter every day and improve the quality of life through science and technology.

My blog is a platform to share my experiences, interests, introspection and current progress with programming. In addition, I hope to become a better writer by blogging.

I am a data driven individual and always looking to improve my skills and be the best version of myself. Feel free to browse around!
