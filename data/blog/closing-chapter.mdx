# <center> Self Reflection </center>

You never know when life will decide to make you fall flat on your face.

At the start of my developer journey, I had prepared myself for many obstacles, including how to program, how to learn more efficiently and learning how to manage my time effectively. I had my plans and laid everything out.

Unfortunately, I ran into an obstacle I had not planned for. I had an unexpected health issue that had left me in crippling pain. It was an infection that caused me pain when I sat down, when I walked and even when I was laying down.

It was the first time in my life that I have ever experienced a panic attack during my recovery at the hospital. I remember having shortness of breath, my entire lungs felt tight and I experienced a tingling feeling spreading through my chest to the edge of my fingers.

I was discharged from the hospital 3 days later. I had multiple visits to a nurse clinic for wound care every week, with each visit taking a bit of my soul and energy during the pain I had endured. After 5 months of dealing with the pain and antibiotics, I had felt mentally exhausted and beaten.

# <center >Third Post Surgery</center>

I slowly drifted in and out of consciousness to the sound of my heart monitor beeping. I felt like I was in complete bliss, my mind was completely disconnected from my body.

With the drugs still running through my system I went back to sleep and woke up 30 minutes later being wheeled into another section of the hospital feeling a little more awake.

I remember the nurse reading me the papers for post surgery recovery and he told me something that I will never forget:

<blockquote>Take the pain medication as needed. Don't try to be a hero.</blockquote>

</center>
<i className="flex justify-center">Wait... how did he know I tried being a hero? Who told him?!</i>

During my second surgery, I skipped my painkillers post surgery because I felt really good and didn't think I needed it.

I remember my pharmacist telling me that I should take it even if I feel like I don't need it yet because the drugs from post surgery will wear off and I'll be in pain.

I didn't listen because I felt fine and thought I could do without it. I hated the feeling of being drowsy and I had already taken so many opioids I just wanted to take a break from it.

That next morning, I paid for it dearly...

I woke up in so much pain that I couldn't even walk. I collapsed to the floor and crawled to my nightstand to reach the prescribed Tramacet, and while I was crawling like an idiot, I hear my pharmacist's voice replaying in my head.

I guess it was just a coincidence that the nurse had told me that... but I thought it was kind of funny considering that I had in fact tried playing the <i>"hero"</i>.

I poorly misjudged my ability to handle pain, especially a day post surgery and I did not make the same mistake this time.

# <center>Remifentanil and Ketamine</center>

I am crossing my fingers that this will be the last and final surgery for this problem. I really hope the third time is a charm and I will not be looking forward for another one.

Before my surgery, the anesthesiologist walked me through the steps and procedures and asked if I had any questions. I was genuinely curious as to what he was going to give me to make me sleep and he told me it was a mixture of remifentanil, propofol and ketamine.

I wrote about [propofol](/blog/propofol/) and was curious about remifentanil and ketamine.

# <center> What is Remifentanil? </center>

It is a potent short-acting synthetic opioid analgesic drug given to patients undergoing surgery<sup><a href="https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00899" target="_blank">[1]</a></sup>. It is used to supplement general anesthesia during induction and maintains pain during anaesthesia.<sup><a href="https://tinyurl.com/y2c3zmqt" target="_blank">[4]</a></sup>

Remifentanil is approximately twice as potent as fentanyl and 100-200 times as potent as morphineðŸ‘€.<sup><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/chemistry/remifentanil" target="_blank">[2]</a></sup>

It has a synergistic effect with propofol meaning that it makes it very effective for anesthesia.<sup><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3022128/" target="_blank">[3]</a></sup>

## <center> How does it work? </center>

It binds to mu-opioid receptors, which reduces the activity of the central nervous system reduce pain<sup><a href="https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00899" target="_blank">[1]</a></sup>. It effectively blunts haemodynamic responses to stimuli during anaesthesia.<sup><a href="https://tinyurl.com/y2c3zmqt" target="_blank">[4]</a></sup>

# <center>What is Ketamine?</center>

Ketamine is a fast-acting anesthesic and painkiller that is excellent for short-term medical procedures.<sup><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK470357/" target="_blank">[5]</a></sup>

It has been a well-established drug that has been in use for over 50 years.<sup><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210844014200062" target="_blank">[6]</a></sup>

## <center>How does it work? </center>

Ketamine works by interacting with NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptors, opioid receptors, monoaminergic receptors, muscarinic receptors and voltage sensitive calcium ion channels.<sup><a href="https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB01221" target="_blank">[7]</a></sup>

By blocking the NMDA receptors, it induces a state called dissociative anesthesia which distorts perceptions of sight, sound and generate a feeling of detachment from the mind and body.<sup><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK470357/" target="_blank">[8]</a></sup>

It does not act on GABA receptors like other general anaesthetic agents like propofol and is administered either IV (intravenous) or IM (intramuscular) injection.<sup><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK470357/" target="_blank">[9]</a></sup>

# <center>Conclusion</center>

I guess the ketamine made me feel pretty awesome. All in all, I would rate my comfort level post surgery to be 10/10 but the entire health journey to be 0/10. Life taught me a tough lesson and I hope to never go through this again.
