The nurse told me to take Celebrex along with Tylenol an hour before my surgery back in October and since I've never heard of it before, I figured to do some research to see what I was taking. This post is a little late but I wanted to post it anyway.

# <center> What is Celebrex? </center>

Celebrex is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used to relieve pain, swelling and inflammation<sup><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3303994/" target="_blank">[1]</a></sup>.

## <center>How does it work? </center>

It prevents the synthesis of a chemical called prostaglandin by inhibiting a specific enzyme called cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2). It binds near the active binding site of COX-2 via the sulfonamide side chain, this inhibition prevents COX-2 from creating precursors that become converted to prostaglandin and thromboxane<sup><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3303994/" target="_blank">[1]</a></sup>.

Prostaglandin accumulation causes inflammation, pain and swelling. They play an important role in pain perception by sensitizing peripheral nociceptors<sup><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15005014" target="_blank">[2]</a></sup>.

Therefore, by inhibiting its synthesis, it will provide the intended effect for pain management.

## <center>Celebrex with Tylenol (acetaminophen) </center>

Acetaminophen can be combined with opioids or NSAIDs to improve pain relief because NSAIDs produce analgesia through a different mechanism (in the peripheral tissues) compared to acetaminophen (brain and spinal cord)<sup><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15005014" target="_blank">[2]</a></sup>.

The exact mechanism of acetaminopheon remains unknown but studies show that they have very weak inhibition of COX-1 and COX-2 and therefore is a bad anti-inflammatory.
However, by combining with Celebrex, we can enhance the analgesic effect through two different pathways and have anti-inflammatory effects that Tylenol lacks<sup><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15005014" target="_blank">[2]</a></sup>.

I always confuse myself with Tylenol and Advil (an NSAID) since they're both for pain-relief, but now I know that if I need an anti-inflammatory with pain relief, I should go with the latterüëç.
