# 🧠 Self Reflection

### 🪴 What did I learn this week?

- Finished going through the concepts of Arrays, LinkedLists and Recursion

### 🍅 Pomodoros?

- I did 6 Pomodoro's last week

### ☕ Focused?

- I noticed that I would be pretty tired after work, this is very similar to what I had experienced when I was working full-time and learning new concepts that I wrote about [here](/blog/year-journey-summary) during my career transition.
- I will be using ChatGPT to monitor any signs of burnout and using my previous experience, I will use the technniques I learned about [managing my energy](/blog/managing-energy) to prevent burnout.
