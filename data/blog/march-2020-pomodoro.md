I've completed 115 [Pomodoro's](/blog/pomodoro-technique/) (2875 minutes) in March. This is 12 more Pomodoro's than [last month](/february-2020-pomodoro/), an increase in productivity by 300 minutes.

Having reflections allow me to measure how much I've done and what I've accomplished to achieve my goals. It helps me stay accountable in my journey in completing The Modern React Bootcamp.

## <center>Reflection</center>

March has been both eventful and uneventful. I was in Amsterdam this month for 5 days, and shortly after coming home, COVID-19 news took over in North America.

I managed to put in work this month and completing a lot more Pomodoro's than I expected even though I had 5 days of non-productive work. Undoubtedly due to the self quarantining and social distancing required by the government.

I'm about 70% done the Modern React Bootcamp and have already learned so much. I have built 5 React projects while coding along and made my own tweaks. I cleaned up my github repositories to capture what I've learned in each project and I'm excited to finish the last milestone application.

I have changed my status to looking for work. I am trying to see if I can still enter the job market during these unsure times. In the meantime, I will continue to stick with my Pomodoro process and continue learning.

## <center>Improvements to Pomodoro Reporting </center>

I will no longer be using Pomotodo to track my Pomodoro's. My subscription will be ending next month for their premium model and will be moving over to <a href="https://pomodoneapp.com/" target="__blank"> PomoDoneApp </a> using Zapier to trigger calendar events.

It has been a great journey using Pomotodo, I'm happy to say that I've tracked and completed over 1000 Pomodoro's on their web application.

I'm looking forward to using <a href="https://pomodoneapp.com/" target="_blank">PomoDoneApp</a> as it seems to have much more features which can help improve my organization and workflow.
