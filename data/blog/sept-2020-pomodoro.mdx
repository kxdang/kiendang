I've completed 8 [Pomodoro's](/022-pomodoro-technique/) (200 minutes) in September. This is a decrease of 6 Pomodoro's compared to last month, a difference of 150 minutes.

Having reflections allow me to measure how much I've done and what I've accomplished to achieve my goals. It helps me stay accountable in my journey to continuously improve my skills

## <center>Self Reflection</center>

I have been taking some weekends to learn more about Redux and the store process. So far, I have been making some progress but it's not where I want to be. I notice after working, I'm generally pretty tired and try to go biking before the sunset.

There are also a few other things I've been keeping my eye on and its mainly the JAMstack conference and NextJS conference next month. It is a free conference to learn more about the latest technologies for the web and I am looking forward to it.

## <center>Improvements</center>

I have made some improvement with Git overall. I have been using more commands at work that I would have not used on my own projects. Mainly rebasing, stashing and some quick shortcuts that I will share in my next post.

I took some time last week to automate my banking to allocate the money accordingly as soon as payday arrives. Now I do not have to deal with any chore work when it comes to my finances so that has been a nice time saver.

There are a couple of more health hurdles I need to overcome before I feel like I am 100%. So I will continue to do whats best and focus on my next goal :).
