I've completed 14 [Pomodoro's](/022-pomodoro-technique/) (350 minutes) in July. This is 10 more Pomodoro's than last [month](/097-july-2020-pomodoro/), an increase in productivity by 250 minutes.

Having reflections allow me to measure how much I've done and what I've accomplished to achieve my goals. It helps me stay accountable in my journey to continuously improve my skills.

## <center>Self Reflection</center>

I spent half of this month recovering from my [third and last surgery](/098-closing-chapter/). I am feeling much better now and glad to be in good health.

## <center>Improvements</center>

I managed to finish a course about git to learn it in-depth as I am using more of it in a collaborative way. I wanted to improve my git skills to make less mistakes at work and I was curious to see how it worked under the hood.

I took an advanced course by Frontend Masters by Nina Zakharenko called <a href="https://frontendmasters.com/courses/git-in-depth/introduction/" target="_blank">Git In-depth.</a>

I purchased a bike! During the pandemic, all the bikes have been sold out and I recently was able to snag one up before the winter comes around. I'm hoping to ride all fall and hopefully make up for the lack of exercise this year.

I hope to continue my journey in data structures and algorithms in the next few months. Although I have paused it for now, I am still in the process of finding the best time to do them.
