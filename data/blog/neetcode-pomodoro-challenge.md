There was a time when a timer and sheer will carried me from zero to full-time developer.

That rhythm generated momentum — 25 minutes of focus and 5 minutes of rest — was how I taught myself how to code.

Today, I return to that rhythm and welcome it like an old friend. **NeetCode x Pomodoro** isn’t just a challenge but a reconnection to the lifelong learner in me, and a step forward deepening the technical skills expected of a seasoned developer still hungry to grow.

# <center> 🚀 Mission </center>

I’ve hit a point where I want to sharpen my problem-solving skills and also learn the industry wide benchmarking tool of grading software engineers.

On top of that, I want to enjoy coding again and learning a new skill that will forever benefit me in my career as a developer. A new skill that will allow me to see code in a different perspective, recognizing patterns and understanding it at a deeper level.

## The System

As someone who spent [1031 Pomodoro’s](/blog/year-journey-summary) reskilling to be developer, I’m curious to know how many Pomodoro’s it will take me to learn Data Structures and Algorithms and be comfortable doing LeetCode questions.

I am feeling more ambitious than ever this year — driven to continue growing — and this sense of renewed motivation is something I want to capitalize on.

It’s the same energy I felt when I first took a [leap of faith](/blog/the-jump) and built my entire ability to learn how to program using the Pomodoro technique as the foundation.

I had a clear version of where I wanted to be, and I was commited to making it real.

**What I’ll be doing:**

- Using the Sessions app to track every Pomodoro session
- I’ll be using [NeetCode’s roadmap](https://neetcode.io/roadmap)
- Logging the problems I solved, what I learned and what tripped me up

A similar system I developed when I had been documenting my journey in programming.

This marks the first day of my journey diving into NeetCode. I'll be blogging weekly about my progress, tracking how many Pomodoros I've completed, and what I've learned along the way.

My goal is to tackle hard questions by the two-month mark which is an ambitious timeline, but one I'll adjust based on my momentum and how I'm feeling throughout the journey.

This isn’t just a grind for the sake of it. It’s me choosing to grow on my own terms. Title or not, I’ll know I earned it — one problem, one Pomodoro at a time.
