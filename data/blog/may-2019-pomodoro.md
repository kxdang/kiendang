There was a total of 92 pomodoros, equivalent to 38 hours last month and that was split between my React course, learning about algorithms and from freeCodeCamp. The pomodoros are now on full effect compared to what I had before with a full-time.

Previously, with a full-time job, weekends were the only times I really did any programming work, but now the difference is literally night and day as seen above and below respectively (best work time from night to noon - pun intended).

# <center>Self Reflection</center>

I found that I‚Äôm extremely productive in early mornings. During the afternoon, my brain starts to get sluggish, from around 2 pm to 3 pm is when my productivity decreases significantly and I start to lose focus. My goal was to hit 8 pomodoros every day, but when I first started, I was only able to hit 4/8 on most days. To combat sluggishness, I would jog around this time to [increase my energy levels](/blog/managing-energy/) and to enjoy the beautiful summer weather.

During the last 2 weeks of May, I was able to hit 6/8 without any issues as my ‚Äúmental stamina‚Äù became much better with practice and routine. Early this month, I‚Äôve hit my 8 pomodoro goal multiple times and I feel like this is the progress I‚Äôve been satisfied with.

Although the hours are not as crazy as the 8 hours per day that comes with a full-time job, I could honestly say that nobody has the energy and capacity to work the 8 hours every day at 100% efficiency and productivity. Based on my experience, a working full-time person would be at 75% productivity on average due to urgent email requests, meetings and other external interruptions that occur at a job.

That gives us about 30 hours on average of working time from a full-time job which equates to 5 hours per day not including 1-hour lunch. My 8 pomodoros hit 3.3 hours which is 1.7 hours shy of a full-time job. My goal is to be consistent and be able to spend my time developing skills to pursue my passion for programming and improve other aspects of my life through self-learning.
