My mouth has swollen on my left side, pain in my eye socket and throat, just my luckðŸ˜«.

My left wisdom tooth erupted without any issues 2 years ago and now hits me like a left hook in my mouth. My dentist prescribed an oral rinse called Peridex (chlorhexidine gluconate) paired with amoxicillin to reduce the inflammation caused by bacteria.

## <center>What is Chlorhexidine gluconate? </center>

Chlorhexidine gluconate is a disinfectant and antispectic with a broad spectrum of medical uses ranging from skin disinfection prior to surgery, sterlizing medical equipment, wound cleaning and treating dental infections<sup><a href="https://chlorhexidinefacts.com/mechanism-of-action.html" target="_blank">[1]</a></sup><sup><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16128251" target="_blank">[2]</a></sup>.

It has bacteriostatic (growth inhibition) and bactericidal (killing bacteria) effect depending on concentration. Therefore, making it more effective than just regular antibiotics and other antimicrobials<sup><a href="https://chlorhexidinefacts.com/mechanism-of-action.html" target="_blank">[1]</a></sup><sup><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6485388" target="_blank">[3]</a></sup>.

It is on the WHO List of Essential Medicines, the safest and most effective medicines needed in a health system.

## <center>How does it work?</center>

Chlorohexidine gluconate works by binding to the bacterial cell wall which compromises the integrity of the bacteria. The molecule is positively charged which helps it bind to the negatively charged lipid layers of the cell membrane<sup><a href="https://chlorhexidinefacts.com/mechanism-of-action.html" target="_blank">[1]</a></sup>.
When the bacterial cell wall is destroyed, it crosses into the cell and attacks the inner membrane causing more damage<sup><a href="https://chlorhexidinefacts.com/mechanism-of-action.html" target="_blank">[1]</a></sup>.

The destabilization of the cell wall and cytoplasmic membrane causes interference with osmosis and eventually causes apoptosis (cell death).

It is very effective in oral applications because chlorhexidine gluconate binds to the mouth tissues, oral mucosa and teeth. Over time it is released which kills the bacteria in the mouth and prevents dental plaque<sup><a href="https://chlorhexidinefacts.com/mechanism-of-action.html" target="_blank">[1]</a></sup>.

When paired with an antibiotic like amoxicillin, it becomes a combination therapy treatment making it more effective in killing bacteria. I guess I can't catch a break with these bacterias.
