My first post of 2023! I havenâ€™t been writing much but a lot has changed since the end of 2022.

I recently underwent a major change in my career path by successfully landing a new role at another company! I feel incredibly fortunate to have been given the opportunity to join the web platform team at theScore. Their technology stack aligns closely to my previous employer and Iâ€™m excited to be more proficient with GraphQL and Apollo.

I switched over my blog from Gatsbyjs to Nextjs styled with Tailwind. I merged both my portfolio website and blog into one and Iâ€™m no longer hosting on Netlify as I switched to Vercel.

Iâ€™m also writing on a day where Reddit officially shut down their third party API access which has been quite interesting. I feel like after 10 years of Reddit on my phone using Sync for Reddit, I will no longer be on the site as much, which I think is a good thing ðŸ˜…

# Continuous Learning in 2023 ðŸª´

Iâ€™ve completed the React Query course which was well paced and presented. Iâ€™m planning on a small project that will utilize this library since it makes querying data much easier with React.

At work, we use Apollo where they have a very similar hook called useQuery, there seems to be a ton of overlap which is nice to see. We also use TailwindCSS, which has been a joy to use and I was able to quickly create a home page for my blog. However, I do miss writing SASS styling.

As for the TypeScript course on Educative, I have not been keeping up with this. I found that most of my time has been dedicated to ramping up at my new position. Iâ€™m going to try to pace myself and take my time.

For the books I've read so far:

- The Way of Kings - Brandon Sanderson
