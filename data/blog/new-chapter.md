After many interviews, I am excited to announce that I am employed as a Software Developer at Coveo! I feel extremely grateful and lucky to have been able to find full-time employment during these rough times.

It has been exactly 12 months since I had left my previous employer and after months of hard work, and an exhausting journey, I'm eager to start a new chapter in my life.

Looking back, when I took a leap of faith, I ended up stumbling with a health issue that took me 5 months to recover from. During that time, I felt like I had already completely derailed from the path I had planned out.

I had taken [9 courses of antibiotics](/tags/biochemistry/), [4 different opioids](/opioids/), had 2 surgeries and lost about 20lbs. I honestly didn't even know what to think, at the time, I was battling the worst pain I've ever experienced and having to face the biggest enemy, myself.

From feeling the biggest FUD (fear, unknown and doubt) and dealing with the side-effects of my medications, I was able to reframe my mindset to only focus on what I was able to control. It allowed me to stay consistent and persevere through my hardships with a positive attitude.

While I had been recovering, I read a book called <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40121378-atomic-habits?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=UrDSU4j0JP&rank=1" target="_blank">Atomic Habits</a> by James Clear and started applying the techniques mentioned in the book.

I started small and developed positive rituals and routines to get me back on my feet. I developed monthly [Pomodoro reports](/tags/pomodoro), solely focusing on the [process](/blog/pomodoro-technique/) instead of the overall goal. Eventually, these monthly reports helped my visualize my efforts which fueled my progression in programming.

In addition, I love self improvement and optimizing every aspect of my life. I really believe that continuous improvement is the key to success. I read <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18693655-a-mind-for-numbers" target="blank">A Mind for Numbers</a> by Dr. Oakley to learn how to learn more effectively which became my initiative to improving my Pomodoro process.

I have been able to document every possible steps I have taken to show how far I've come. I have listed all courses and the exact number of hours spent on studying and learning which can be viewed [here](/year-journey-summary/).

I have been extremely grateful to have the support of my family and friends, without them, I know that I wouldn't have gotten this far. I have been in a very privilege position to be able to achieve my goals, that being said, I made sure I effectively utilized the opportunity I was given to make the career change.

In addition, I am finally in a position where I can make donations to support organizations that accelerate positive values to make the world a better place. In recent events, I plan on making donations to campaigns that support the Black Lives Matter movement and help contribute to the changeüôè.
