I've completed 103 [Pomodoro's](/blog/pomodoro-technique/) (2575 minutes) in February. This is a decrease of 21 Pomodoro's compared to [last month](/blog/january-2020-pomodoro/), a difference of 525 minutes.

Having reflections allow me to measure how much I've done and what I've accomplished to achieve my goals. It helps me stay accountable in my journey in completing The Modern React Bootcamp (Hooks, Context, NextJS, Router) from Colt Steele on Udemy.

## <center>Reflection</center>

Another 100 Pomodoro month! üôåüéâ One feature of the Pomotodo app is the synchronization with Google Calendar so I can visually see the number of Pomodoro's completed per day.

Earlier this month, I noticed I had a rough time starting up my Pomodoro streak and I definitely experienced some kind of burn-out due to last month. I really wanted to start the new year with a bang which resulted in a record high Pomodoro for myself. I was so focused on completing my MERN course and other projects that I might have triggered a slow start coming into February.

However, I‚Äôm more surprised I reached another 100 Pomodoro‚Äôs this month as it is now the second highest number of Pomodoro‚Äôs I‚Äôve ever done. I have been running and meditating and it has been increasing my overall energy and well-being respectively. It is introduced as running twice a week and meditating for 5 minutes every day. My focus has now shifted in completing the Modern React Bootcamp to gain more knowledge in React and building a few small projects to practice my JavaScript.

## <center>What I completed: </center>

- A Personal Portfolio (deprecated as of 2023)
- Completed the Advanced CSS and SASS course from Udemy (Nature site, Trillo app, Realtor site) found in my portfolio. I‚Äôm excited to use flexbox and CSS grid in my future projects.
- Created a [Now page](/now/) - a useful reminder of what I am currently doing. This will help me see if my monthly Pomodoro‚Äôs align with my priorities and goals, this page is inspired by David Sivers.
