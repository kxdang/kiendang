# <center>What is cephalexin?</center>

<p><a href="https://www.drugs.com/cephalexin.html" target="_blank">Cephalexin</a> is an antibiotic that can treat a number of bacterial infections including skin infections, respiratory tract and urinary tract. Similarly to amoxicillin, they are in the Î²-lactam antibiotic class. Cephalexin is also a first-generation cephalosporin antibiotic; they originated from a fungus originally known as Cephalosporium<sup><a href="https://www.medicinenet.com/cephalexin/article.htm" target="_blank">[1]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Cephalexin is on the list of most effective and safe medicines found on the World Health Organization's <a href="https://www.who.int/medicines/publications/essentialmedicines/en/" target="_blank">List of Essential Medicines.</a></p>

## <center>How does cephalexin work?</center>

Cephalexin kills gram positive and gram negative bacteria by using their Î²-lactam ring, a special cyclic amide, to bind to penicillin-binding proteins which prevent a process called transpeptidation<sup><a href="https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Microbiology/Book%3A_Microbiology_(Kaiser)/Unit_1%3A_Introduction_to_Microbiology_and_Prokaryotic_Cell_Anatomy/2%3A_The_Prokaryotic_Cell_-_Bacteria/2.3%3A_The_Peptidoglycan_Cell_Wall" target="_blank">[2]</a></sup>.

By preventing transpeptidation, the bacterial cell walls will not have the structural integrity to resist osmotic lysis. As a result, the bacteria will release enzymes to self-destruct or burst due to osmotic imbalance as a result of cephalexin<sup><a href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Cephalexin" target="_blank">[3]</a></sup>.

## <center>Common side effects of antibiotics</center>

Like many antibiotics, it may cause cases of pseudomembranous colitis which is the inflammation of the large intestine due to the overgrowth of _Clostridium difficile_. The overgrowth of _C. difficle_ causes the build up of its toxins that causes the inflammation and thus cause diarrhea<sup><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4402243/" target="_blank">[4]</a></sup>.
