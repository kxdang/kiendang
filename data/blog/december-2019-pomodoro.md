# <center>Happy New Year!</center>

I've completed 90 [Pomodoro's](/blog/pomodoro-technique/) (2250 minutes) in December. This is a decrease of 2 Pomodoro's compared to [last month](/blog/november-2019-pomodoro/), a difference of 50 minutes.

Having reflections allow me to measure how much I've done and what I've accomplished to achieve my goals. It helps me stay accountable in my journey in completing a MERN Udemy course and becoming a self-taught developer.

My self-reflection for December has been combined with my [2019 summary](/2019-yearend-pomodoro/). I thought it would be a good idea to have a year summary of 2019.
